# Ambient Map demo

This web application demonstrates how Ambient light sensor can be used to control style of a map widget. When ambient illuminance level is less than 10 lumen, night mode style will be used.

The project has been moved to [generic-sensor-demos](https://github.com/intel/generic-sensor-demos/tree/master/ambient-map) repository.
